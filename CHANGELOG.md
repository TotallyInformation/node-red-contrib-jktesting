### 0.3.0 - 

* Properly isolate the JS code in the html file to prevent name clashes
* Change `text/x-red` to `text/html` in html file
* Breaking change: use of ES6 means that minimum Node.js version is now v10

### 0.2.0 - Update for Node.JS v8 and Node-RED v0.19

* Tidied up the code
* Improved code by splitting out complex vars/fns
* Improved JSDoc comments
* Added some links to official documentation
* Improve some of the logic
* Added an example configuration node

NB: The Editable List node is still not working. Sorry, I'll try to get to that next.

### 0.1.1 - Minor tweaks

### 0.0.0 - not a release
